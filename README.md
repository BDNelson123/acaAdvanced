The goal of this project was to create a multi-user trading web application using the Symfony framework to build an "eBay for the housing market" website. Each developer built a personal VM using Vagrant to work locally on their personal environment. Built controllers, entities and configured the routing to include CRUD and validations into restful API end points. Learned the use of bundles within Symfony and refactored the PHP object oriented programming to use Symfony's Doctrine ORM. 

During this project, all the developers excelled in the use of Git branching and git pull requests for collaboration. The developers used the agile methodology to build the project quickly and with few errors. Developers created task lists and managed tickets with the use of Trello and utilized Slack to communicate remotely while working remotely.
